# HTML + Tailwind Sandbox

A simple, fast sandbox for building and testing HTML components. Hot reload on frontend frameworks can be slowâ€”this helps speed up development.

## Features

- **Fast Prototyping**: Quickly test and build HTML components.
- **TailwindCSS v3.4.16**: Pre-downloaded CDN file for offline use.
- **No Build Step Required**: Just open your HTML file and start coding.
- **Works with VS Code Live Preview**: Provides an instant live reload experience.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mjavason/HTML-Tailwind-Sandbox
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in VS Code.
3. Install the **Live Preview** extension by Microsoft from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) to view changes right in your IDE.
4. Click the preview button at the top right of the editor, enjoy!

## Project Structure

```
/project
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.js      # Local Tailwind CDN file
â””â”€â”€ README.md        # Project documentation
```

## Usage

- Modify `index.html` to test different components.
- Use Tailwind classes directly without any setup.
- Save your file, and Live Preview will instantly update your changes.

## Why Use This?

- **Faster than full frontend frameworks**: No need to wait for slow hot reloads.
- **No npm, no build tools**: Just HTML + Tailwind for quick testing.
- **Great for UI experimentation**: Quickly tweak designs before integrating into larger projects.

Happy coding! ðŸš€

ps: Ignore the `workshop` folder. It contains my component/work files and is not part of the main project setup.
